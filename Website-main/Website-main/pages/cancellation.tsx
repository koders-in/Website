          All the services provided by Koders including Web Design, Web
          Development, Mobile Application Development, Software Development,
          Website Maintenance are accepted and carried out after a thorough
          analysis and the creation of a detailed scope document, ensuring that
          our teams have a full understanding of the work that needs to be done
          and removing the possibility of project cancellation. Since Koders and
          the client understand that there is work involved to achieve every
          milestone of the project, a refund would not be possible for the work
          once assigned to us. A refund is only possible up to a certain extent
          on mutual agreement from both parties when things don't seem to be
          working for valid reasons.
          <br />
          <br />
          Client payments for custom design projects and services are made in
          increments and are non-refundable. You will receive a guarantee of a
          refund if we stop our services and they are no longer operational. If
          a project is cancelled or postponed, Koders holds all charges paid,
          and the client is responsible for all work completed beyond what was
          already paid for.
          <br />
          <br />
          We can’t guarantee a full refund for the cancellation of our services.
          But, if you change your mind after paying us for a certain service,
          then we will act only refund or cancel services according to the
          following guidelines:
        </p>
        <ul
          data-aos="fade-up"
          className="font-miligramLight text-[1.05rem] text-main-white-700 w-[96%] mx-auto text-justify list-disc pl-4 md:pl-10 mt-3 aos-animate"
        >
          <li>
            Koders will refund you, in full, if a project has not started within
            30 days of making payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the event that information has been incorrectly provided to us by
            you, Koders does not offer any refunds or money back for services
            once work has commenced and/or has been completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don’t want Koders to start the project at all, you may ask
            for a full refund within 24 hours of making payment. If the project
            has not commenced during this 24 hour period, Koders will deduct any
            expenses, charges, and admin fees incurred and refund you
            accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you commence a monthly or yearly service with us and request the
            service to be cancelled, you must notify Koders at least 30 business
            days prior to the next billing period, or unless otherwise noted in
            your Contract or Service Agreement with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you request a cancellation of service and your account has been
            incorrectly charged after the notice period, we will refund 100% of
            that amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            Koders does not offer any refunds for funds spent on search engines,
            for the services already delivered, or any other miscellaneous
            charges which are non-recoverable for Koders, and refunding them
            causes any loss to Koders.
          </li>
